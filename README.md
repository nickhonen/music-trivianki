# Music Trivianki Backend

## To Do

DONT OVER OPTIMIZE. Focus on the business logic/problems. The spotify API isn't even a huge part of the app.

- [ ] Hookup Spotify API service to a route
- [ ] you dont have to use separate routers/services yet but you should be able to hit the api through the main app.
- [ ] Add Get playlist endpoint, make sure you can hit it through the main app. Should authenticate and stuff.
- [ ] Add an integration test/unit test for the get playlist endpoint just so you know the flow.
- [ ] Add Spotify API
